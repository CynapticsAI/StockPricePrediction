# Stock Price Prediction(to be remade later)

#### This project will use a few different approaches to predict stock market price. Time series prediction models like meta's prophet and lstm model would be the major ones. We would use google colab to do it. We will mostly just try to do prediction for some particular stock first(due to data and compute constraints) later on maybe we can train it on different stocks. Look up the resource docs try to implement them in a google colab notebook(do it step by step like the data preparation first then commit and continue like this(do the commits in a python file, no need to upload the notebook, notebook is where you run the code as it can provide the GPU if needed)).
